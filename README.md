# fjl-data-identity (WIP (Work in progress))
Fjl Data.Maybe and Data.Either implementations in javascript.

## Reasoning
- Mimick haskell's Maybe and Either data types.
- Use the js platform's features to implement the required functionality.

## Testing
- `jest` - @todo add url 
- `chai` - @todo add url
